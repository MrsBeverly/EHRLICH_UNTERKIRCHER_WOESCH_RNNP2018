    // connection to the server persist until the process is completed. The entity

    // resource characteristics and locations from which the user or user agent can

    //9.4 Client Error 4xx
    //The 4xx class of status code is intended for cases in which the client seems
    // to have erred. If the client has not completed the request when a 4xx code
    // is received, it should immediately cease sending data to the server. Except
    // when responding to a HEAD request, the server should include an entity
    // containing an explanation of the error situation, and whether it is a temporary
    // or permanent condition. These status codes are applicable to any request method.

    // be careful to ensure that the client acknowledges receipt of the packet(s)
    // containing the response prior to closing the input connection. If the client
    // continues sending data to the server after the close, the server's controller
    // will send a reset packet to the client, which may erase the client's
    // unacknowledged input buffers before they can be read and interpreted by the
    // HTTP application.

    // included Authorization credentials, then the 401 response indicates that
    // authorization has been refused for those credentials. If the 401 response
    // contains the same challenge as the prior response, and the user agent has
    // already attempted authentication at least once, then the user should be

    // been fulfilled, it should describe the reason for the refusal in the entity
    // body. This status code is commonly used when the server does not wish to

    // is applicable.

    // server is aware that it has erred or is incapable of performing the request.

    // should immediately cease sending data to the server. Except when responding
    // to a HEAD request, the server should include an entity containing an explanation
    // of the error situation, and whether it is a temporary or permanent condition.

    // overloading or maintenance of the server. The implication is that this is
